        <p>Hi, I am from South Africa and I am a proud Zulu man. I use to work work at a hospital's admissions office before I came to BYUI. Something ineresting about me is I can speak 5 languages which are English, Setswana, Malagasy, Zulu and Sesotho. I served my mission in the Madagascar Antananarivo mission and it was a amazing exprience because I got to learn a new language and meet a lot of amazing people.</p>
        <p>Things I like to do include playing video games, board games and bascially any kind of games. I love to be around people although I am bit shy at times. I also love watching movies and weirdly I actually enjoy watching romantic comedies.</p>
        <p>I am so grateful to be here at BYUI because it is such a cool expirence to be around people who share the same beliefs as me. I am majoring in software engineering.</p>
